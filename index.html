        <ul>
          <li>Do you love the idea of someone living in your house, but hate the idea of someone living in your body?</li>
          <li>Are you ethically conficted about your right to play God, literally forcing another thinking human being into a harsh uncaring world without their consent?</li>
          <li>Do you cry yourself to sleep at night knowing that even as you read this, a child somewhere is hungry and doesn't know where to get any food?</li>
          <li>Do you ever wonder where everyone is going to live in 200 years?</li>
